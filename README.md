## 📌 Project Background & Business Needs  
A community foundation provides support to charities through sustainable funding programs. It acts as a bridge between donors and charities.  

After conducting surveys, it was determined that a **centralized platform** was needed to assist with:  
- **Fundraising**  
- **Granting**  
- **Operations**  
- **Marketing**  
- **Storytelling**  

This platform aims to streamline services and provide a more efficient way for charities and grant seekers to connect with donors and funding opportunities.

## 🎯 Target Users  

### **NorthStar Customers (Primary Users)**  
These include **charities and grant seekers** who require:  
- Collaboration with organizations  
- Clear guidelines for grant applications  

### **Carryover Customers (Secondary Users)**  
These include **donors and grant providers**, who need:  
- Easy-to-use services  
- A seamless experience without frequent platform access  

While the primary focus is on these user groups, the platform could also be expanded to serve other institutions in the future.

## ✅ Project Assumptions  
The project is built using the following tools:  
- **WordPress** (Content Management System)  
- **Figma** (UI/UX Design)  
- **StoriesOnBoard** (User Story Mapping)  

Some team members had no prior experience with these tools but have been actively learning to maximize the platform’s quality.

## ⚠️ Constraints  
As students, we face several challenges:  
- **Limited experience** with certain technologies  
- **Learning curve** for collaborative tools  
- **Scheduling conflicts**, making collaboration across different times and availability difficult  

Despite these constraints, we are committed to developing an effective and user-friendly solution.

## 🚀 Future Potential  
If successful, this platform could be expanded beyond charities and grant seekers to serve other organizations and institutions, increasing efficiency in the nonprofit sector.
